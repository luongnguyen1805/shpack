# shpack

**shpack** is a Go-based build tool that bundles multiple shell scripts into a single, portable executable.  
It lets you organize scripts hierarchically, distribute them as one binary, and run them anywhere — no dependencies required.

## Installation

*(Works on macOS and Linux via Homebrew.)*

## Overview

`shpack` enables developers to:

* Bundle multiple shell scripts into a single binary
* Preserve folder hierarchy and script dependencies
* Deliver zero-dependency executables to end users
* Support Linux, macOS, and BSD out of the box

## Project Structure

```
myproject/
├── scripts/
│   ├── main.sh          # Entry point
│   ├── dependency.sh    # Supporting scripts
│   ├── utils.sh
│   └── ...
├── shpack.yaml          # Optional build configuration
└── build/
    └── mytool           # Generated executable
```

---

## Build Configuration (`shpack.yaml`)

```yaml
name: mytool              # Output executable name
entry: scripts/main.sh    # Entry point script
scripts: scripts          # Directory containing scripts
version: 1.0.0
```

---

## Runtime Environment

When the executable runs, shpack provides the following environment variables:

| Variable                                               | Description                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `SHPACK_SCRIPT_DIR`                                    | Path to extracted temporary script directory |
| `SHPACK_USER_DIR`                                      | Path to user working directory               |
| `SHPACK_VERSION`                                       | Version of the bundled scripts               |

> Inside your scripts, you can safely `source ./env.sh` or use relative paths — they resolve within `SHPACK_SCRIPT_DIR`.

## Dependencies

### Build-time

* Go **1.16+** (for `embed` support)
* YAML parser: [`gopkg.in/yaml.v3`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v3)

### Runtime

* Bash shell (`/bin/bash` or equivalent)
* No additional dependencies

---

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Initialize project
shpack init sample

# Edit scripts inside sample/scripts/

# Build executable
shpack build sample

# Run built tool
./sample/build/mytool
```
